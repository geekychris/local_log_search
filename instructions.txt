I want a service that will tail log files and index them.  Lucene is my preferred search engine.  The service should have a UI, perhaps vaadin flow based.  User should be able to control indexing and querying from both the ui and a rest interface.  The service should be able to configure which logs to tail, an optional way to parse the log and then a ui that allows to query the log.  Logs should be parsed with an assumption that the log entry contains regular queryable text but also the log should be parsable into fields.  By default log entries can have a key=value syntax where key would be indexed in a lucene field and value is the indexable value. We should be able to parse out timestamp.  Search should support splunk type queries including perhaps simple things like aggregation.  You should create a test app that generates log output to use for testing.  Ask me any questions to help clarify.  Remember this is supposed to be similar to simple local version of splunk to help a developer debug logs.
