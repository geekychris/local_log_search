/**
 * Trampoline main-class that JavaFX's runtime accepts when the app
 * is packaged as a fat JAR.
 *
 * <p>Rationale: JavaFX 11+ refuses to start when the main-class
 * itself extends {@link Application} unless launched with a proper
 * {@code --module-path} pointing at the JavaFX modules. That works
 * under jpackage but breaks {@code java -jar fat.jar} dev iteration.
 * The standard workaround is a plain (non-Application) main-class
 * that calls {@link Application#launch} — bypasses the "runtime
 * components missing" check because JavaFX only inspects the
 * immediate main-class, not the launched one.
